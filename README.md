# sunday-site-profile
My user profile for [Sunday Sites](https://sundaysites.cafe/), which is a project by John Bengtsson created in 2020 as a graduation project. Each month, people gather around and receive a theme or instruction to build their website upon, and then in three hours come back and present their sites. However, you are also allowed to go through previous session's instructions and create a website post-session if you are unable to make it, or if you have only just found Sunday Sites. It looks very interesting, and so I have made a user page for it which will then contain any sites I create inspired by the prompts.

Currently under-construction, as I have not contributed to Sunday Sites yet.
